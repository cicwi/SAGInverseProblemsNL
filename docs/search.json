    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete."

    "text": "In inverse problems, one tries to recover a quantity of interest from indirect, imperfect measurements. A classical example is given by Computed Tomography (CT), which reconstructs an image of the interior of a patient from its tomographic X-ray projections. Inverse problems occur in a wide range of applications in science, health care, and industry. The Special Activity Group (SAG) involves various fields of discipline, including mathematics, physics, earth sciences, radiology. The goal of the SAG is to provide a platform for the Dutch inverse problems community to meet up, discuss the latest developments in the field, and establish a network for collaboration and grant proposals.\nThe SAG is funded in part by the NDNS+ Cluster\nIf you want to stay updated on our events, consider subscribing to our mailing list, or keep an eye on the announcements on this page."
