## Summary

The 5th IMA Conference on Inverse Problems from Theory to Application takes place 8-10 September 2026 at Woburn House, Tavistock Square, London.
 
The meeting brings together researchers working on the theoretical, numerical, and computational aspects of inverse problems, alongside those tackling challenging applications. This year includes a dedicated Big Data Day (joint with the IMA Conference on the Mathematical Challenges of Big Data), focusing on links between model-based methods and modern data-driven approaches (e.g. deep learning, generative models, neural operators, large-scale optimisation).

**Topics of Interest**

* Machine Learning & Data-Driven Methods: Deep learning for inverse problems, learned regularisation, neural operators, unrolled networks. 
* Big Data, Statistics & Optimisation: Large-scale inverse problems, 
* Bayesian inference, uncertainty quantification, data assimilation, stochastic algorithms. 
* Mathematical Theory: Analysis of inverse problems, stability, uniqueness, and regularisation theory. 
* Imaging & Applications: Mathematical and computational imaging, tomography, and wider applications in science, medicine, and engineering. 
 
Call for papers/posters: submit a 300-word abstract via [https://my.ima.org.uk/](https://my.ima.org.uk/) by 31 May 2026.
